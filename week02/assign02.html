 <h1>Bryce Maughan's Home Page</h1>

 <p>My name is Bryce, and I’m a VDC (Virtual Design and Construction) Major. After this semester I will have my Programing Certificate that will hopefully help me get an internship at a more technologically modern construction company where I can learn things not taught in a classroom. My career goal, currently, is to gain knowledge and experience to fully take advantage of a new degree that is pioneering new possibilities using technologies within construction and architectural design.</p>
  
 <p>I’m living in Rexberg Idaho, Mountain Daylight Time, Monday  -  Thursday I’m free around 9:00 - 10:00 am and 5:00pm ~ 7:00pm; I’m planning on being mostly free Friday afternoons and Saturdays.</p>
  
 <p>I recently got married in September last year to a very amazing woman. If I have spare time, I enjoy playing/studying video games like Elite Dangerous, or reading Louis l’Amour books or random web novels by amateur/aspiring writers.</p>
